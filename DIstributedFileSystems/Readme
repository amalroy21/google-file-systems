Simple Google File System
Designed a distributed system with multiple clients and server, and a metadata server. Metadata server maintains metadata about files in the file system and is also responsible to keep track of all alive servers. A file is made up of multiple chunks of fixed size and each chunk has 3 replicas in 3 different servers. Clients can perform following operations:

Read from a chunk to be performed from any alive replicas.
Append data to all live replicas of the chunks using two-phase commit protocol.
Create new file in any 3 servers selected by metadata server at random.
